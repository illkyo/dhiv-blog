# dhiv-blog
A website/web app designed to be a mix of a social media platform like Twitter and other blogging websites. The main selling point of this project is that all functions of the site are in the Dhivehi language. The intended purpose of it is to encourage Dhivehi Thaana writing and improve speaking of the language in the Maldivian youth population; a fully Dhivehi-Only platform. Made primarily with the Django and Bootstrap frameworks.

Completed in 2024. This was my submission for the coursework component of the module 'Systems Development', part of the Computer Science Bachelor's Degree course by UWE (University of West England) for the second year. With this submission I got 68 marks out of 100 for the component, a passing grade. A coursework specification document is available in the repo for further reading on assessment details. This is not deployed or fully fleshed out as of yet because I made this just to showcase the concept.

# How to Use
Clone this project using 'git clone' into a folder of you choosing. Then either set up a python virtual environment for this project and then, using python pip installer install the packages listed in requirements.txt or install the same way without setting up one. (Make sure to activate the virtual environment if one was made)

Upon installation, change directory to the location where this project is located and run the command 'python manage.py runserver' which will host the site on a local server on your PC.
